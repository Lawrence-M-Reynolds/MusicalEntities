/**
 * This abstract class is extended in each rule which is then instantiated whenever
 * a rule is broken. The report comments which is passed through the constructor
 * will be displayed to the user on the Counterpoint.
 * 
 * In order to draw markings relating the offending notes/SpeciesElements a separate
 * object is used - the CounterointAnnontationObject. Although this isn't defined in 
 * this abstract class it is in the extended class and the drawResultMarkings() method
 * is overridden to draw feedback based on points held within these objects. 
 * 
 * These objects are set passed into the the SpeciesElements in question as well as
 * the concrete RuleReport Object. It is then carried over to the CompositionBarEvents
 * that the speciesElements are translated into. When they are drawn by the drawerer
 * the point is passed into the CompositionBarEvents which then passes it to the
 * annotation object. Because it is the same object as is held in the Rule report, 
 * drawResultMarkings(Graphics g) will know where to draw.
